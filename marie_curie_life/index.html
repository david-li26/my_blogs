                Maria Skłodowska, known today as Marie Curie, was born in Warsaw, Poland on the 7th of November 1867, which was under the rule of the Russian Empire. She was the youngest of five children. Her father, Władysław Skłodowski, was a physics and mathematics educator. His profession sparked her interest and love for science. Her mother, Bronisława Skłodowski, was the headmistress of a girls’ school. Her role as a headmistress emphasised education and discipline during Marie’s upbringing.

                Marie faced many childhood difficulties, including poverty and cultural restrictions. When she was just ten, Marie unfortunately witnessed her mother’s tragic illness due to tuberculosis. Consequently, Marie and her siblings relied on their father’s education. Despite these challenges, Marie’s resilience propelled her development and led to her successful education. However, she faced adversity as universities in Poland denied her entry because of her gender.

                Marie and her sister Bronya reached an agreement and devised a plan to support each other’s education. Their plan was that Marie would first work to pay for Bronya’s education, and then Bronya would work to fund Marie’s education. During this period, Marie worked as a governess while Bronya studied at the Sorbonne in Paris, France. Once Bronya secured a steady job, Marie moved from Poland to Paris to study at the Sorbonne in 1891 with Bronya’s financial support, earning a degree in physics in 1893 and another in mathematics in 1894.

                After graduating from university, Marie stayed in Paris to pursue a career in science. She took a job researching in Gabriel Lippmann’s physics laboratory, where she studied magnetism. Shortly after, Marie and Pierre met at a meeting organised by Józef Kowalski-Wierusz, a Polish scientist who recognised their shared interests. They gradually developed a relationship based on scientific collaboration and mutual respect. In mid-1894, Pierre proposed marriage. Although Marie wanted to return to Poland, she realised that the University of Kraków had rejected her application due to their biased views on gender. Consequently, Marie reconsidered Pierre’s proposal, and they married in 1895, which resulted in a significant shift in her career path and future achievements.

                Marie then researched radioactivity, a term she coined. She discovered the element polonium, which she named after her homeland, Poland, and radium. Both elements were extremely radioactive and led to remarkable advancements in technology, both in the past and today. For this, Marie became the first woman to earn the Nobel Prize in 1903 for her work in radioactivity, followed by another Nobel Prize for discovering polonium and radium just eight years later. Marie Curie remains the only woman to hold two Nobel Prizes.

                Marie tragically passed away on the 4th of July 1934 at the age of 66 due to a rare condition known as aplastic anaemia, which was caused by prolonged exposure to ionising radiation during her work on radiation. Marie’s legacy was carried on by her two daughters, Irène Joliot-Curie and ève Curie, who followed in their mother’s footsteps and achieved remarkable results. One of Irène’s accomplishments was earning a doctorate in physics in 1925 and working at the Radium Institute, now the Curie Institute, to honour Marie Curie’s achievements. One of ève’s contributions was writing ‘Madame Curie’ in 1937, a biography that reflected Marie’s life and genius. Written in several languages, it has inspired many generations and will continue to do so.

                In my opinion, Marie was a truly remarkable person. She endured her childhood pain and made significant contributions to today’s technology and methodologies. She changed medical applications, testing, safety, and much more. I believe she is an extraordinary individual, and her inspiring story will be told for generations to come.
